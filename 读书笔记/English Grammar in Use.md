4. fly -> flew -> flown

5. we use the past simple to say that one thing happened afu er another:

   When Karen arrived, we had dinner.
   (= Karen arrived, and then we had dinner)

6. When we use the present perfect, there is a connection with now. The action in the past has a result now:

   简单式强调时间，而完成式强调结果

   We say ‘It’s the (first) time something has happened：

   It’s the first time he has driven a car. (not drives)

   Sarah has lost her passport again. This is the second time this has happened. (not happens)

7. We use the present perfect continuous for an activity that has recently stopped or just stopped:
   Why are you out of breath? Have you been running?
   Paul is very tired. He’s been working hard.

   How long have you beening learning English?

   How long have you beening waiting?

   We have beening waiting for 20 minutes.

   可翻译成：**刚刚一直在**

   可能刚刚停止也可能还在继续

   完成进行时强调动作

   完成时强调结果

   how long have you been married?  

   ** ing和ed都可看作形容词**

   > We use the present perfect to talk about something that began in the past and still
   > continues now.

   But we use the simple (have lived etc.) with always:
   I’ve always lived in the country. (not always been living)
   
   It is two years since I last saw Joe. or It has been two years since
