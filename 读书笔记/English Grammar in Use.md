8. 现在完成式和过去式

   现在完成式能表明当前的状态或结果

   过去式只能说明这件事在过去的时间节点发生过，但不能表明现在的状态或结果

   We use the present perfect for a period of time
   that continues until now. For example:
   **today** / this week / since 2010.

   We use the past simple for a finished time in
   the past. For example:

   there **were** no buses.

9. 截止到过去的时间，用过去完成时 had done

10. had been doing 强调动作持续截止到过去的时间

    You can say that something had been happening before something else happened:
    We’d been playing tennis for about half an hour **when** it started to rain heavily.

    **When** we got home last night, we found that somebody had broken into the flat.

    用完成时还是完成进行时与when无关，二者有时可通用

    否定句

    I **didn't use to** ...

    I used to do VS **I am used to doing**

    I am used to living alone.习惯了某事

13. **I’m doing** something (tomorrow etc.) = I have already decided and arranged to do it:
    a: What are you doing on Saturday evening? (not What do you do)
    b: I’m going to the cinema. (not I go)

    We also use the present continuous for an action just before you start to do it. 

    已经安排好的或者正在做的用现在进行时，不能用will

    谈论时间表的时候用一般时

    We use the present simple when we talk about timetables and programmes (for example, transport or cinema times):
    I have to go. My train leaves at 11.30.
    What time does the film start tonight?
    The meeting is at nine o’clock tomorrow.

    I think I will ...

    will you ...?

    shall I/we...?

    will不能用于已经计划好的事

    I can't meet you tomorrow morning. I'm playing tennis.

    I think James will go to the party on Friday. (= I think he will decide to go)

    You can use if + any:
    Let me know if you need anything.

63. I have no luggage.

    ‘How much luggage do you have?’ ‘None.’ or ‘I don’t have any.’

    None of the students were/was happy. 

64. We use **much and little** with uncountable nouns:

    We use **many and few** with plural nouns: many people

    We use **a lot of / lots of / plenty of** with both uncountable and plural nouns:

    Much is unusual in positive sentences:

    We didn’t spend much money. but We spent a lot of money.

    little = not much, few = not many: 几乎没有

    a little = some, a small amount:

    a few = some, a small number:

    luggage不可数 a lot of luggage

65. You don’t need of after all or half. So you can say:
    All my friends live near here. or All of my friends …
    Half this money is mine. or Half of this money …

    We say: all of us / all of you / half of it / half of them etc. You need of before it/us/you/them:
    All of us were late. (not all us)
    I haven’t finished the book yet. I’ve only read half of it. (not half it)

    We spent all day on the beach. or We spent the whole day …
    Dan was very quiet. He didn’t say a word all evening. or … the whole evening.
    Note that we say **all day** (not all the day), **all week** (not all the week) etc.

69. - We use **each** when we think of things
      separately, one by one.
      Study each sentence carefully.
      (= study the sentences one by one)
    - We use **every** when we think of things as a
      group. The meaning is similar to all.
      Every window in the house was open.
      (= all the windows in the house)
    - Each (but not every) can be used for two things:
      In football, each team has eleven players. (not every team)
    - We use every (not each) to say how often something happens:
      ‘How often do you use your car?’ ‘Every day.’ (not Each day)
      There’s a bus every ten minutes. (not each ten minutes)
    - **everyone** and **every one**
      Everyone (one word) is only for people (= everybody).
      Everyone enjoyed the party. (= Everybody …)
      Every one (two words) is for things or people:
      Sarah is invited to lots of parties and she goes to every one. (= to every party)

70. - We use **who** in a relative clause for people (not things):
      The woman who lives next door to me is a doctor.

    We also use that for people, but not which:
    The woman that lives next door to me is a doctor. (not the woman which)
    Sometimes you must use who (not that) for people

    - When we are talking about things, we use **that** or **which** (not who) in a relative clause:
      I don’t like stories that have unhappy endings.
      or … stories which have unhappy endings.

      In these examples that is more usual than which, but sometimes you must use which. 

71. - You must use who/that/which when it is the subject of the relative clause:

      The woman who lives next door to me is a doctor.

      Where are the keys that were on the table?

    - When who/that/which is the object, you can leave it out. So you can say:

      The woman I wanted to see was away. or The woman who I wanted to see …

      Did you find the keys you lost? or … the keys that you lost?

72. - Compare who and whose:
      I met a man who knows you. (he knows you)
      I met a man **whose** sister knows you. (his sister knows you)

    - Whom is possible instead of who when it is the object of the verb (see Unit 93B):
      George is a person whom I admire very much. (I admire him)

      You can also use a preposition + whom (to whom / from whom / with whom etc.):
      It’s important to have friends with whom you can relax. (you can relax with them)

      Whom is a formal word and we do not ofu en use it in spoken English. We usually prefer to say:
      a person I admire a lot or a person who/that I admire a lot

    - We use where in a relative clause to talk about a place:
      I recently went back to the town **where** I grew up. (I grew up there)

    - We say ‘**the day** we got married’, ‘**the year** I was born’, ‘**the last time** they met’ etc. :

73. - My brother Ben,** who** lives in Hong
      Kong, is an architect.
- Anna told me about her new job, **which**
      she’s enjoying a lot.
    - We stayed at the Park Hotel, **which** a
      friend of ours recommended.
    - 
    - In these examples, the relative clauses do not
      tell you which person or thing the speaker
      means. We already know which thing or
      person is meant: ‘My brother Ben’, ‘Anna’s new
      job’ and ‘the Park Hotel’.
      The relative clauses in these sentences give us
      extra information about the person or thing.
    - We use commas (**,**) with these clauses:
      My brother Ben, who lives in Hong
      Kong, is an architect.
    - You cannot use **that**
    - You cannot leave out **who** or **which**
    - You can use **whom** for people
  
74. - You can use a preposition + whom (for people) and which (for things).
      So you can say:
      to whom/ with whom/ about whom etc.
      of which /without which/ from which etc.
      - Mr Lee, **to whom** I spoke at the meeting, is interested in our proposal.
      - Fortunately we had a good map, **without which** we would have got lost.
      
    - In spoken English we often keep the preposition after the verb in the relative clause:
      
      - Katherine told me she works for a company called ‘Latoma’, which I’d never heard of before.
      
    - We do not use whom when the preposition is in this position:
      
      -  Mr Lee, who I spoke to at the meeting, is interested in our proposal.(not Mr Lee, whom I spoke to …)
      
    - all of / most of etc. + whom/which
      You can say:
      Helen has three brothers, **all of whom** are married.
      They asked me a lot of questions, **most of which** I couldn’t answer.
    
    - Joe got the job , which surprised everybody. 
    
      In this example, which = ‘the fact that Joe got the job’. 
    
75. - We use lefu in this way, with the meaning ‘not used, still there’:
      We’ve eaten nearly all the chocolates. There are only a few left.
    - You can also use an -ing clause to say what happens all the time, not just at a particular time:
      The road **connecting** the two villages is very narrow. (the road connects the two villages)
      I have a large room **overlooking** the garden. (the room overlooks the garden)
      Can you think of the name of a flower **beginning** with T? (the name begins with T)

76. Somebody is bored or gets bored if something (or somebody else) is boring.
    If something is boring, you get bored with it.
    So:
    Jane is bored because her job is boring.
    Jane’s job is boring, so Jane is bored. (not Jane is boring)

    the **-ing** adjective tells you about the job

    the **-ed** adjective tells you how somebody feels (about the job).

77. Not all words ending in -ly are adverbs. Some adjectives end in -ly too, for example:
    **friendly lively elderly lonely lovely**
    It was a **lovely** day.

78. hardly = very little, almost not:

    Hardly goes before the verb:
    We hardly know each other. (not We know each other hardly)

    **Well** is also an adjective meaning ‘**in good health**’:
    ‘How are you today?’ ‘I’m very well, thanks.’

    well-informed 见多识广的

    **fast, hard and late**
    These words are both adjectives and adverbs:
    adjective adverb
    Darren is a fast runner. Darren can run fast.

    You can use **hardly + any/anybody/anyone/anything/anywhere**:
    a: How much money do we have?
    B: Hardly any. (= very little, almost none)

79. **Quite** and **pretty** are similar in meaning (= less than ‘very’, but more than ‘a little’)

    Anna lives quite near me, so we see each other pretty ofuen.

    Pretty is an informal word and is used mainly in spoken English.

    Sarah has **quite a** good job.
    Sarah has **a pretty** good job.

    You can also use quite (but not pretty) in the following ways:

    quite a/an + noun (without an adjective):

    I didn’t expect to see them. It was **quite a surprise**. (= quite a big surprise)
    quite a lot (of …):
    There were **quite a lot of **guests at the wedding.
    quite + verb, especially like and enjoy:
    I **quite like** tennis, but it’s not my favourite sport.

    **Rather** is similar to quite and pretty. We ofuen use rather for negative ideas (things we think are not
    good):
    The weather isn’t so good. It’s rather cloudy.

    When we use rather for positive ideas (good/nice etc.), it means ‘unusually’ or ‘surprisingly’:
    These oranges are rather good. Where did you get them?

    **Fairly** is weaker than quite/rather/pretty. For example, if something is fairly good, it is not very
    good and it could be better:
    My room is fairly big, but I’d prefer a bigger one.

    Quite also means ‘completely’. For example:
    ‘Are you sure?’ ‘Yes, quite sure.’ (= completely sure)

    Compare the two meanings of quite:
    The story is quite interesting. (= less than ‘very interesting’)
    The story is quite true. (= completely true) 固定搭配

    I quite agree you.

80. far → further (or farther)
    It’s a long walk from here to the park – further than I thought. (or farther than)
    Note that further (but not farther) also means ‘more’ or ‘additional’:
    Let me know if you hear any **further news.** (= any more news)

81. **older** and **elder**
    The comparative of old is older:
    David looks older than he really is. (not looks elder)
    We use elder only when we talk about people in a family (my elder sister, their elder son etc.).
    You can also use older:
    My elder sister is a TV producer. (or My older sister …)
    But we do not say that ‘somebody is elder’:
    My sister is older than me. (not elder than me)

    I can't wait **any** longer.

    It's **no** worse than usual.

82. If the verb is one word (drives/cooked etc.), the adverb goes before the verb:

    I cleaned the house and **also** cooked the dinner. (not cooked also)

    Note that these adverbs (always/usually/also etc.) go before have to … :
    Joe never phones me. I **always** have to phone him. (not I have always to phone)
    But adverbs go after am/is/are/was/were:
    We were feeling very tired and we were **also** hungry. (not also were)

    If the verb is two or more words (for example, can remember / will be cancelled), the adverb
    usually goes afuer the first verb (can/doesn’t/will etc.)

    The house was **only** built a year ago and it’s **already** falling down.

83. Compare still and not … any more:
    Sally **still** works here, but Lucy **doesn’t** work here **any more**./any longer

    we are **no longer** friends.

    We use **yet** mainly in negative sentences (He isn’t here yet) and questions (Is he here yet?).
    **Yet (= until now)** shows that the speaker expects something to happen.
    Yet usually goes at the end of a sentence:
    It’s 10 o’clock and Joe isn’t here **yet**.

    Is it **still** raining?
    Has it stopped raining **yet**?

84. even though / even when / even if
    We use even though / even when / even if + subject + verb:

    He never shouts, **even when** he’s angry.
    This river is dangerous. It’s dangerous to swim in it, **even if** you’re a strong swimmer.

    (= It rained a lot, but they …)
    or
    **In spite of** the rain, they had a good time.
    **Despite** the rain, they had a good time.

    I didn’t apply for the job **though** I had the necessary qualifications.
