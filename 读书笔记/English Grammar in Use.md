1. I am doing -> in the middle of sth 在一个时间段/点

   > We use the continuous for things happening at
   > or around the time of speaking.
   > The action is not complete.

   a change has started to happen: getting, becoming, starting

2. I do -> in general/ often/ truth

   > We use the simple for things in general or things
   > that happen repeatedly.

   I apologise/advise/suggest/insist/agree/refuse/promise

   how often do you ...?

   I agree with you.

   be always doing -> more often than normal

3. am/is/are being

   > We use am/is/are being to say how a person is behaving (= doing something they can control) now.

4. fly -> flew -> flown

5. we use the past simple to say that one thing happened afu er another:

   When Karen arrived, we had dinner.
   (= Karen arrived, and then we had dinner)

6. When we use the present perfect, there is a connection with now. The action in the past has a result now:

   简单式强调时间，而完成式强调结果

   We say ‘It’s the (first) time something has happened：

   It’s the first time he has driven a car. (not drives)

   Sarah has lost her passport again. This is the second time this has happened. (not happens)

7. We use the present perfect continuous for an activity that has recently stopped or just stopped:
   Why are you out of breath? Have you been running?
   Paul is very tired. He’s been working hard.

   How long have you beening learning English?

   How long have you beening waiting?

   We have beening waiting for 20 minutes.

   可翻译成：**刚刚一直在**

   可能刚刚停止也可能还在继续

   完成进行时强调动作

   完成时强调结果

   how long have you been married?  

   ** ing和ed都可看作形容词**

   > We use the present perfect to talk about something that began in the past and still
   > continues now.

   But we use the simple (have lived etc.) with always:
   I’ve always lived in the country. (not always been living)
   
   It is two years since I last saw Joe. or It has been two years since  
   
8. 现在完成式和过去式

   现在完成式能表明当前的状态或结果

   过去式只能说明这件事在过去的时间节点发生过，但不能表明现在的状态或结果

   We use the present perfect for a period of time
   that continues until now. For example:
   **today** / this week / since 2010.

   We use the past simple for a finished time in
   the past. For example:
   yesterday / last week / from 2010 to 2014.

   

   there **were** no buses.

9. 截止到过去的时间，用过去完成时 had done

10. had been doing 强调动作持续截止到过去的时间

    You can say that something had been happening before something else happened:
    We’d been playing tennis for about half an hour **when** it started to rain heavily.

    **When** we got home last night, we found that somebody had broken into the flat.

    用完成时还是完成进行时与when无关，二者有时可通用
