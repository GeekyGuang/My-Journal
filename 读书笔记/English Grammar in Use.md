1. I am doing -> in the middle of sth 在一个时间段/点

   > We use the continuous for things happening at
   > or around the time of speaking.
   > The action is not complete.

   a change has started to happen: getting, becoming, starting

2. I do -> in general/ often/ truth

   > We use the simple for things in general or things
   > that happen repeatedly.

   I apologise/advise/suggest/insist/agree/refuse/promise

   how often do you ...?

   I agree with you.

   be always doing -> more often than normal

3. am/is/are being

   > We use am/is/are being to say how a person is behaving (= doing something they can control) now.

4. fly -> flew -> flown

5. we use the past simple to say that one thing happened afu er another:

   When Karen arrived, we had dinner.
   (= Karen arrived, and then we had dinner)

6. When we use the present perfect, there is a connection with now. The action in the past has a result now:

   简单式强调时间，而完成式强调结果

   We say ‘It’s the (first) time something has happened：

   It’s the first time he has driven a car. (not drives)

   Sarah has lost her passport again. This is the second time this has happened. (not happens)

7. We use the present perfect continuous for an activity that has recently stopped or just stopped:
   Why are you out of breath? Have you been running?
   Paul is very tired. He’s been working hard.

   How long have you beening learning English?

   How long have you beening waiting?

   We have beening waiting for 20 minutes.

   可翻译成：**刚刚一直在**

   可能刚刚停止也可能还在继续

   完成进行时强调动作

   完成时强调结果

   how long have you been married?  

   ** ing和ed都可看作形容词**

   > We use the present perfect to talk about something that began in the past and still
   > continues now.

   But we use the simple (have lived etc.) with always:
   I’ve always lived in the country. (not always been living)
   
   It is two years since I last saw Joe. or It has been two years since  
   
8. 现在完成式和过去式

   现在完成式能表明当前的状态或结果

   过去式只能说明这件事在过去的时间节点发生过，但不能表明现在的状态或结果

   We use the present perfect for a period of time
   that continues until now. For example:
   **today** / this week / since 2010.

   We use the past simple for a finished time in
   the past. For example:
   yesterday / last week / from 2010 to 2014.

   

   there **were** no buses.

9. 截止到过去的时间，用过去完成时 had done

10. had been doing 强调动作持续截止到过去的时间

    You can say that something had been happening before something else happened:
    We’d been playing tennis for about half an hour **when** it started to rain heavily.

    **When** we got home last night, we found that somebody had broken into the flat.

    用完成时还是完成进行时与when无关，二者有时可通用

11. have sth = have got sth

    过去时用had，否定和疑问用do/did,  没有had got

    have a shower/ have a swim/ have breakfast等只能用have

    I've got a sore throat.

    do you have ...?

    have no time

    have a look at it

12. I **used to do** something = I did it ofu en in the past, but not any more:

    I used to play tennis a lot, but I don’t play very much now.

    过去常常做，但是现在不做了

    We also use used to … for things that were true, but are not true any more:
    This building is now a furniture shop. It used to be a cinema.

    疑问句

    **Did you use to** go to swimming?

    否定句

    I **didn't use to** ...

    **never used to **

    I used to do VS **I am used to doing**

    I am used to living alone.习惯了某事

13. **I’m doing** something (tomorrow etc.) = I have already decided and arranged to do it:
    a: What are you doing on Saturday evening? (not What do you do)
    b: I’m going to the cinema. (not I go)

    We also use the present continuous for an action just before you start to do it. 

    已经安排好的或者正在做的用现在进行时，不能用will

    谈论时间表的时候用一般时

    We use the present simple when we talk about timetables and programmes (for example, transport or cinema times):
    I have to go. My train leaves at 11.30.
    What time does the film start tonight?
    The meeting is at nine o’clock tomorrow.

    When you talk about appointments, lessons, exams etc., you can use I have or I’ve got:
    I have an exam next week. or I’ve got an exam next week.

14. I'm going to (do) 决定好了要做，但是时间不确定

    somthing is going to happen 可以断定某件事要发生

    I was going to 本来计划好了要做但是没有做

    somthing was going to happen 本来要发生但是没有发生

    What were you going to say?你刚刚想说什么？

    否定 I'm not going to do

15.  ** will** 用于临时当场做的决定 “将/会” 或者是对将来的预言

    We use will to say what we know or believe about the future (not what someone has already decided).

    如果是在说话之前就做过了决定用be going to, 我要做某事

    I think I will ...

    will you ...?

    shall I/we...?

    will不能用于已经计划好的事

    I can't meet you tomorrow morning. I'm playing tennis.

    

    I think James is going to the party on Friday. (= I think he has already decided to go)
    I think James will go to the party on Friday. (= I think he will decide to go)

    

    I shall/shan't= I will/won't

    

    will 和 be going to 都可以用于对将来的预言

    be going to 基于客观事实的推测

    will 基于直觉

     It's going to be a nice day.

    He will be late again.

16.  will be doing / will have done

    maybe

    - We use may and might to talk about possible actions or happenings in the future:

    I may/might buy a car

    - But we use might (not may) when the situation is not real:
      If they paid me better, I might work harder. (not I may work)

    - We might as well do something = we should
      do it because there is no better alternative.
      There is no reason not to do it.
      You can also use may as well.

    Buses are so expensive these days, you might as well get a taxi.
