# 序
- 大量阅读，不求甚解。
- 词源分析工具有帮助
- 《TIME中文解读版》

# 五种句型
S + V
S + V + O
S + V + C
S + V + O + O
S + V + O + C
在所有的英语动词中，只有解释为“是”的动词是空的，完全没有意义。也只有这种动词才需要补语(complement)来补足句子的意思。

判断是不是补语:
主语/宾语 + 是 + 补语

# 名词短语
名词短语包括限定词、形容词、名词三个部分。任一部分都可能省略。

冠词 a(n)
复数或不可数则不用a(n)

专有名词(具有唯一性) 不用限定词

定冠词the(明指/暗示 “那个”) 表示这个东西有两个以上
the Pacific (Ocean)
the Atlantic (Ocean)



所有格有两种表示方式：人与其他生物可
用’s的形式，无生物则用of...

the legs of the table

a nobody 无名小卒

# 时态

简单式 + 完成式

根据时间是在区间还是截止到来判断是简单式还是完成式

把Be动词看成动词，过去分词v+ed和现在分词v+ing看成形容词补语
分词只能当形容词

I was watching TV when I heard the doorbell.

s + v + c

简单式的时间是一个区间，过去，现在，将来的一段时间内。这个区间可大可小。只要可以括出时间来就是简单式。

完成式则是以箭头形状来表达时间，表示动作的截止时间。完成式并不对动作发生的时段作明确的交代，只表示“曾经”、“做过”的意思。
(从一个时间点算起)截止到...

把be动词当做动词看，那么再复杂的动词时
态也只剩下两种变化，不是简单式就是完成式

has/had/will have  been 完成式
was/is/will be 简单式

# 不定词短语

不确定语气是不定词与助动词之间一个很重要的共同点，可以用来判断何时该用不定词。
助动词：may, can, must

不定词和助动词后面只能接动词原形
must — have to
should 一 ought to
will/would — be going to
can/could — be able to
may/might 一 be likely to

They plan to marry next month
s + v + o(to marry)

I avoid making the same mistake twice.
s + v + o(making...动名词)

只有动名词和不定词可以做名词类使用

使役动词 make sb do
be made to do 使役被动要加to
be used to do 常常做
be used to doing 动名词

# 动名词
四种动状词(Verbals):
- 动名词 Gr
- 现在分词 PP
- 过去分词 Ven
- 不定词 Inf

持续性与动作性，就是动名词常有的特色。
动名词短语可以视为名词从句的变化。只要把主语和be动词放回去，就会出现完整的名词从句。

take a swim
object to 这里的to是介词，后面接名词

# 分词和形容词
在名词短语和补语位置，可用分词取代形容词

It is gone 这里不是被动，是形容词补语
I'm done 过去分词表完成

现在分词有“进行”的暗示, 过去分词有“被动”、“完成”的暗示。

the case is being investigated by police.
being investigated 分词作形容词

Toys **made in Taiwan** are much better now
Toys which are made in Taiwan...
Children **living in orphanages** make a lot of friends.
Children who are living in ...
形容词从句

Having finished the day's work, the secretary went home.
She had finished the day's work
副词从句，主语相同，没有be动词不能简化，改成having ...

# 形容词

形容词用来修饰名词 attributive adjectives
单词形状的形容词，出现在**名词从句、补语**

a **new** camera
someone **else**
money **alone** 

a **cigarette** box
my **pencil** sharpener
a **five-year-old** child
复合名词中间只能用单数

补语位置形容词
the lake is deep
the balloon stays afloat

形容词比较级
A is shorter than B 
A is less difficult than B
A is **as boring as** B   等于

只有在名词短语中才加定冠词a/the
补语位置是不加的

that/those
Cars made in Taiwan are better than **those** made in Korea

倒装
A chimp has as much I.Q. as a child of five or six does.
A chimp has as much I.Q. as **does** a child of five or six.

well off 富有
better off

he tried to talk in the loudest voice possible
most of  大部分
the most of 最...的

superior to 优于
inferior to 劣于

his intelligence is superior **to** yours
不能用than

by far 表示差得远

# 副词

方法、状态的副词(Adverbs of Manner)
这一类的副词是修饰动词专用的，典型的拼法是形容词加上 -ly字尾。

the child giggled happily under the caress of its mother
s + v

He kept quiet resolutely
s + v + c

He passionately kissed the girl living next door.
s + v + o 

强调语气的副词:
- 范围 only merely
- 语气 utterly badly
- 程度 almost hardly

修饰句子的副词:
连接句子：however, therefore, besides
分离副词：Honestly, what are you going to do about it?

more often than not 经常
I **clean** forgot it. 完全地
dead tired
keep clear of 避开
sometimes 有时候
sometime 不特定的时间
some times 若干次
some time 一些时间
last 上一个
little better
farther距离  further程度
stand firm保持镇定

# 语气
- 叙述事实
- 条件
- 假设
- 祈使

条件语气
must should will/would can/could may/might
will/would can/could may/might只是语气上的变化，后者比前者更不确定

语气助词没有表达过去的能力(因为过去是确定的)，要用完成式表达
it may have rained a little last night.

假设，用过去表示非事实
It's time you kids were in bed.
If only I had more time.

祈使句用原型
Leave the courtroom.

**单词、语法句型要通过大量的阅读input才能真正掌握。**

# 介词

made from 形态不容易关联
made of 
among没有标示位置的能力

点 at
线 on along
面 on
体 in

from ... to... 不确定(开区间)
from ... through ... 闭区间

at the sound 听到声音的那一刻
a right to对某事的权利
长x宽 中间的念by
be sold at 100 dollars. at价格
in the sun


Everyone but a few complete idiots was able to see that.
The eggs, not he hen, were stolen.
Not only you but also I was at fault.

Mrs.Lindsey, together with her sons, is on a European tour.
There is a list of things to buy in the handbag.
A pair of pants is hanging on the wall.
These pants are very fancy.

### 集合名词
staff, clew, family, faculty, police, committee
表示所有人时用复数，表示集体组织时用单数
The committee are mostly Republican politicians.

# 第二篇 复句(Complex Sentences)、合句(Compound Sentences)

一个句子在另一个句子中间，有主从之分，则称为“复句”，反之用and,or,but连接没有主从之分的为合句。

复句分为三种：
- 名词从句
- 形容词从句(关系从句)
- 副词从句

名词从句
(主语、宾语、补语、同位语)
- 主语位置
**That he didn't show up on time** is strange.
**It** is strange **that he didn't show up on time**

- 宾语位置
I found it strange that he didn't show up on time.

- 补语位置
The important thing is that we are all right.
s + v + c

- 同位语位置
I am afraid that I can't help you.

名词从句放大
The earthquake was a 6.9, said Dr.Chang, Director of the Yangmingshan Geological Observatory.

疑问词改装名词从句(what, when, why...)
I know who you are.

whether 和 if
I can't tell **whether he's telling the truth or not.**
I can't tell **if he's telling the truth or not.**

**Whether** the stock market wil improve or not is impossible to say now.
在句首的whether不能换成if

whether = which + either
The treatment will be decided by **whether** the tumor is malignant or not.
在介词后的whether也不能用if代替

Babylon is what is now Bagdad.

# 副词从句
有逻辑关系的连接词
because, and, though, if

时间、地点
after, until, when, where

条件
if, as long as, suppose

原因、结果
As, now that(既然), so...that..., so that

目的
in order that, lest, in case

让步
Although, while, whether, no matter, whoever, whichever, however, wherever, whenever

限制
As far as(至于), in that(即) = in the sense that

方法、状态
as if

It is such a good opportunity that you should not miss it.
such...that...

Indeed she studied hard, **but** she didn't succeed.
有but前面不能再用though或although

# 关系从句(形容词从句)

两个句子要有交集，
关系词(wh-)

- 名词从句：从句作为主语/宾语/补语/同位语
- 副词从句：副词连接两个句子，逻辑关系
- 关系从句：从句修饰一个字眼(先行词)

关系代词
who, which, whose, whom
关系副词
when, where, how, why

关系代词做宾语可省略

指示功能明确时可用that取代who/which
多指下定义的句子

Money is [the only thing] that interests him.
He's the best man that I can recommend.

无需进一步指认，补充说明的句子应放在逗号后面
加上逗号的关系从句成为“非限定用法”
非限定用法的关系从句不能用that
有逗号，不能省略关系代词/关系副词

先行词的省略(等价于名词从句)
I have what you need.
I'll shoot whoever moves.
You can take whichever car you like.

关系从句的位置
In the basket you find two apples which I bought.
A plague broke out which lasted 20 years.

I need some time (when) I can be with my daughter.

wh-ever 能解释为 no matter wh- 则是副词从句
Whoever stole the money, it can't be John.

I'll fire whoever(anyone that) stole the money.
anyone/anything that 则是关系从句

介词后面不能用that
有先行词才用who, 没有用whoever

All that glitters is not gold.

# 对等从句(合句)
and, but, or

对称
not only...but also...
nor 置于句首要倒装

# 简化从句

复句/合句 -> 简化从句(clear and concise)

**从属从句简化通则:**
省略主语与 be 动词，只留补语
It is common courtesy to wear black while attending a funeral.
Whether insured or not, your house, a wooden building, needs a fire alarm.

有助动词直接改成不定式
He studied hard so that he could get a scholoarship.
-> He studied hard(so as/in order) to get a scholoarship.

没有助动词改成ving
John remembers that he saw the lady before.
-> John remembers seeing the lady before.

# 形容词从句简化
去掉主句和从句间重复的元素
如果重复的元素是关系从句的宾语，则把关系词省略
The man whom you asked about is here.
The man you asked about is here.

补语为过去分词Ven
Beer (which is) chilled to 6 is most delicious.
Your brother John,(who was) wounded in war, will soon be sent home.

补语为Ving

-> My old car, breaking down every other week, won't last much longer.

补语为to v
John is the one who should go this time.
should -> is to
John is the one to go this time.

for 从句主语
I have a job for your brother to do

补语为一般形容词

补语为名词(简化后成为同位语)
